    "prediction": "Phishing",
    "explanation": "Risk Score: 95\n\nThis email is extremely suspicious and carries a very high risk of being a phishing attempt.  My analysis is based on several factors:\n\n**Suspicious Features Detected by the ML Model:**\n\n* **Subject Line:** The subject line, \"WINNER!!! CLAIM NOW $$$,\" uses excessive capitalization, exclamation points, and dollar signs, all typical tactics to create a sense of urgency and excitement to trick recipients into opening the email.  This is a major red flag.\n\n* **Urgent and Threatening Language:** The email demands immediate action, threatening account closure and prize forfeiture if the recipient doesn't respond within 12 hours. This high-pressure tactic is a classic phishing technique designed to bypass critical thinking.\n\n* **Request for Sensitive Information:** The email explicitly asks for bank account details, password, and verification code.  Legitimate organizations would never request such sensitive information via email.\n\n* **Suspicious Link:** The link, \"http://scam-prize.ru/login,\" points to a suspicious domain. The domain name \"scam-prize.ru\" is highly suggestive of fraudulent activity.  Legitimate lottery winners would not be directed to a site with such a name for claiming prizes.  A legitimate organization would use its official website address, and not a random .ru address.\n\n* **Unusual Sender Address:** While the email appears to come from a Gmail account, the sender name, '\"bharani dharan.R\"', doesn't match the email address, \"justinbharani24@gmail.com\". This discrepancy raises concerns about the email's authenticity.  It is possible the sender is using a spoofed address.\n\n**Rules Engine Factors:**\n\n* The rules engine flagged the email based on the combination of urgent language, request for sensitive information, and the suspicious domain name.  These three factors, in conjunction, triggered a high-risk alert.\n\n* The presence of multiple red flags significantly amplified the risk score.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThis email is **highly likely to be a phishing attempt**.  Do not click any links or reply to the email.  Instead, report the email to your email provider and delete it immediately.",

    "risk_score": 95,
    "explanation": "Risk Score: 95\n\nThis email is extremely suspicious and carries a very high risk of being a phishing attempt.  Here's why:\n\n* **Suspicious Link/Domain:** The link provided, \"http://scam-prize.ru/login,\" is a major red flag.  The domain name \"scam-prize.ru\" is clearly suspicious; legitimate lottery organizations wouldn't use such a poorly constructed and untrustworthy-looking domain.  The use of \".ru\" (Russia's country code top-level domain) for a supposed global lottery is also unusual and further adds to the suspicion.  Our ML model flagged this as highly improbable for a legitimate lottery notification.\n\n* **Urgent and Threatening Language:** The email uses phrases like \"act IMMEDIATELY,\" \"within the next 12 hours,\" \"PERMANENTLY CLOSED,\" and \"FINAL NOTICE.\" This aggressive and threatening tone is a common tactic used in phishing emails to pressure recipients into acting quickly without thinking critically. This is a classic rule engine trigger for high-risk classification.\n\n* **Request for Sensitive Information:** The email explicitly asks for sensitive personal information, including bank account details, password, and verification code.  Legitimate organizations would never request this information via email.  This is another key element flagged by both the ML model and the rule engine.\n\n* **Unusual Sender Address:** While not provided in the email snippet, if the sender address doesn't match a known official lottery organization or appears vaguely similar to one, that would be an additional red flag. This was not available to assess in this instance, but it is a crucial point that future analysis would look for.\n\n* **Unlikely Lottery Notification:**  Receiving notification of a lottery win via email, especially one including a request for sensitive financial data is extremely uncommon and inherently suspicious.  The ML model has seen thousands of similar fraudulent emails and flags this type of message as highly improbable.\n\n\n**Summary:** This email is almost certainly a phishing attempt designed to steal your personal and financial information. Do not click the link or respond to the email in any way."
