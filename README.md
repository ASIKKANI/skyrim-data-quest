# SKYRIM: Email Phishing Detection & NLP Explainer

A full-stack project to fetch Gmail emails, detect phishing attempts using ML, and provide NLP-based explanations with Gemini AI.

---

## Features

- üìß **Fetch unread emails from Gmail via IMAP**  
  - Connects to Gmail using the IMAP protocol.  
  - Retrieves unread emails including sender, subject, body, attachments, and timestamp.  
  - **Workflow:** Connect ‚Üí Search ‚Üí Retrieve ‚Üí Process.

- üìù **Save fetched emails as structured JSON files**  
  - Converts emails into structured JSON format for easy storage and further analysis.  
  - Stored in the `saved_emails/` folder.  
  - **Workflow:** Parse email ‚Üí Convert to dictionary ‚Üí Save JSON.

- üõ°Ô∏è **Detect phishing emails using a trained Machine Learning model**  
  - Custom ML model predicts whether an email is phishing or safe.  
  - Features include sender info, keywords, links, and common phishing patterns.  
  - **Workflow:** Extract features ‚Üí Predict phishing probability ‚Üí Save result in JSON.

- ü§ñ **Generate explanations and insights from emails using Gemini NLP**  
  - Uses Gemini AI to provide human-readable explanations of suspicious content.  
  - Helps users understand why an email might be phishing.  
  - **Workflow:** Send email content to Gemini ‚Üí Receive explanation ‚Üí Store in JSON.

- ‚ö° **Expose API endpoints via FastAPI for automation and integration**  
  - Provides endpoints to interact with emails and predictions.  
  - Users can:
    - List all fetched emails.  
    - Get details of a specific email.  
    - Send new email content for phishing detection & NLP explanation.  
  - **Workflow:** Start FastAPI ‚Üí Receive request ‚Üí Query JSON or run prediction ‚Üí Return JSON.
